# AMBA AXI VIP Protocol Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the verification of AMBA AXI protocol using UVM methodology.  
It includes the RTL design, AXI VIP components, and a UVM-based testbench for functional verification and coverage analysis.

## Features
- AXI protocol compliant RTL design
- UVM verification environment
- Driver, Monitor, Agent, Scoreboard, and Coverage components
- Modular and reusable verification setup

## Files Included
- `rtl/` : RTL design files for AXI protocol
- `tb/` : Testbench files
- `uvm/` : UVM classes (env, driver, monitor, scoreboard, agent)
- `sim/` : Simulation scripts or test cases (if any)

## How to Run
1. Compile the RTL and UVM files using your simulator (QuestaSim, VCS, etc.)
2. Run the simulation
3. Check functional coverage and simulation results
